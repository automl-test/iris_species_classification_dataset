**Original URL**: N/A

## Problem Understanding

The system analyzed the problem statement and identified it as a **classification** task with 70% confidence.

**Problem Analysis:**
- **Task Type**: Classification
- **Confidence Level**: 70%
- **Key Features Identified**: features, data

## Dataset

- **Name**: synthetic_dataset
- **Source**: synthetic
- **URL**: N/A

## ML Solution Approach

The machine learning model solves this problem by:

1. **Problem Formulation**: Treats this as a classification task where the model learns to predict categories/classes based on input features.

2. **Model Selection**: After evaluating multiple algorithms, **Unknown** was selected as the best-performing model.

3. **How It Works**:
   - The model learns patterns from historical data
   - It maps input features to output classes/categories
   - Given new data, it predicts the most likely class
   - The model uses learned decision boundaries to make predictions

4. **Solution Capability**: The model can automatically classify new instances into the appropriate category based on the patterns it learned during training.
